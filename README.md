# Jigsaw-Unintended-Bias-in-Toxicity-Classification
##Probem Statement:To detect toxic comments and minimize unintended model bias.

The data contains online conversations and the level of toxicity is given as target in data. We have to classify them and we 
have to predict target toxicity for test data. I have used machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I predict the toxicity 
level for test data.
